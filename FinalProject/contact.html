            <p class = "question">Q: Does Streamline cost money?</p>
            <p class = "answer">A: No, we do not even ask you to make an account to use our services. The streaming services we feature however, like Hulu, do require a subscription. We are in no means a way to access free movies and TV shows, but rather a way to find new TV shows and movies appropriate for your children based on the services you are already subscribed too.</p>
              <p class = "question">Q: What age should children be to use this site?</p>
              <p class = "answer">A: Our target age is from 5-10, but many people may be interested in what we have to offer. We even feature TV shows that teens may be interested for a little bit of nostalgia, like Spongebob and Finding Nemo!</p>
              <p class ="question">Q: Is Streamline a streaming service?</p>
              <p class = "answer">A: No, we are simply an interface to allow searching across multiple streaming services for child freindly content.</p>
